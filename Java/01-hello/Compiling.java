/*
For example, with a file called Plankton.java, we could compile it with the terminal command:

[javac Plankton.java]

A successful compilation produces a .class file: Plankton.class, that we execute with the terminal command:

[java Plankton]

An unsuccessful compilation produces a list of errors. No .class file is made until the errors are corrected and the compile command is run again.
